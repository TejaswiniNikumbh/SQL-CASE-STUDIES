# SQL_CASE_STUDIES
This repository contains a collection of SQL case studies that I have worked on. Each case study is a real-world problem that I have solved using SQL queries. These case studies are designed to showcase my SQL skills and demonstrate my ability to work with data sets. Through these case studies, I have demonstrated the SQL skills like 
Writing complex SQL queries to join, filter, and aggregate data from multiple tables
Using subqueries and nested queries to analyze data
